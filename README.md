## 📋 How the CLI Works

### Command Structure

```bash
python cli/fraudshield.py [CSV_FILE] [OPTIONS]
```

### Available Options

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--method` | `-m` | `both` | Detection method: `rules`, `ml`, or `both` |
| `--threshold` | `-t` | `10000` | Amount threshold for high-value detection |
| `--time-window` | `-w` | `5` | Time window in minutes for rapid transactions |
| `--no-csv` | | `False` | Skip CSV export of flagged transactions |
| `--no-json` | | `False` | Skip JSON summary report export |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | `False` | Suppress banner output |

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Data Ingestion & Validation**
- **Multi-Encoding Support**: Automatically handles UTF-8, Latin-1, and CP1252 encodings
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures required columns are present: `transaction_id`, `user_id`, `timestamp`, `amount`, `merchant`, `location`
- **Data Quality Checks**: Identifies missing values, duplicate IDs, invalid timestamps, and negative amounts
- **Preprocessing**: Converts timestamps, normalizes text fields, and creates derived features

#### 2. **Rule-Based Detection Engine**
Implements business logic rules based on financial industry best practices:

**High-Amount Detection**
- Flags transactions exceeding configurable threshold (default: $10,000)
- Useful for structuring detection and large transaction monitoring

**Rapid Transaction Detection**
- Identifies 3+ transactions from same user within time window (default: 5 minutes)
- Catches velocity-based fraud patterns and potential account takeovers

**Location-Based Detection**
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Flags locations like "unknown", "offshore", "anonymous"
- **High-Risk Jurisdictions**: Detects transactions from sanctioned countries
- **User Behavior**: Identifies unusual locations based on user's historical patterns

#### 3. **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**
Uses Isolation Forest algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection:

**Feature Engineering**
- **Temporal Features**: Hour, day of week, business hours, weekend indicators
- **Amount Features**: Log transformation, round number detection, deviation from user norms
- **User Behavioral**: Transaction frequency, typical amounts, spending patterns
- **Merchant/Location**: Frequency analysis and encoding of categorical variables

**Model Training & Prediction**
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest (contamination rate: 10%)
- **Scoring**: Anomaly scores converted to confidence levels and severity ratings
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis for explainable AI

#### 4. **Results Processing & Deduplication**
- **Duplicate Removal**: Consolidates transactions flagged by multiple methods
- **Reason Merging**: Combines flag reasons for comprehensive explanations
- **Severity Ranking**: Prioritizes by HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW severity levels

#### 5. **Professional Output Display**
- **Colored Terminal**: Uses ANSI colors for visual clarity (red for alerts, green for normal)
- **Tabulated Results**: Clean ASCII tables for summary statistics and detailed transactions
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during processing stages

#### 6. **Comprehensive Reporting**
- **CSV Export**: Complete transaction details with flag metadata for analysis
- **JSON Summary**: Structured data with statistics, risk assessment, and actionable recommendations

## 🧠 Detection Logic & Methodology

### Rule-Based Detection Rationale

**High-Amount Thresholds**
- **Regulatory Basis**: Aligns with CTR (Currency Transaction Report) requirements
- **Customizable**: Adjustable based on business context and risk appetite
- **Industry Standard**: $10,000 default matches banking compliance practices

**Velocity Detection**
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Rapid transactions often indicate automated attacks
- **Time-Window Analysis**: Configurable windows accommodate different business models
- **User-Centric**: Focuses on individual user patterns rather than global averages

**Geographic Risk Assessment**
- **Sanctions Compliance**: Incorporates OFAC and international sanctions lists
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects location inconsistencies in user behavior
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Weights flags based on jurisdiction risk levels

### Machine Learning Approach

**Algorithm Selection: Isolation Forest**
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No need for labeled fraud data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Specifically designed for outlier identification
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large datasets with linear time complexity
- **Interpretability**: Provides anomaly scores for ranking and explanation

**Feature Engineering Strategy**
- **Domain Knowledge**: Features based on financial industry expertise
- **Temporal Patterns**: Captures time-based behavioral patterns
- **User Profiling**: Individual baseline establishment for deviation detection
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Combines amount, time, location, and behavioral features

**Model Performance Considerations**
- **Contamination Rate**: 10% default based on industry fraud rates
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensemble approach with 100 estimators
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for normalized input distributions
- **Threshold Tuning**: Confidence scoring for actionable alerts
